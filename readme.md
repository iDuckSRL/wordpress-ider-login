== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I download the App? =

You can find the IDer app in your App Store or Google Play. Search for "ider".

= Can I hack/improve/fork/edit this plugin? =

Mmmm. Even though we encourage the developing and extension of new plugins it doesn't sound like a good idea in this case.
This plugin has been very tested and stressed and it should be use as it is.
But if you got a brilliant idea or suggestion we would love to hear from you.
